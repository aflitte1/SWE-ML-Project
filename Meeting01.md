- Project Ideas
    - Website that can take data as input and graph the data in a useful way for resarchers
    - The website should have the ability to sort through the graphs dependent on the variables desired by the end user
    - We will be using a Machine Learning algorithm playing the game Pachinko as a way to provide example data to the website
- Potential Users
    - Researchers and Data scientists
- Possible Functionality & Non Functionality Requirements
    - Organize data on website by key features
    - Interactive Website (can run the code from the website and see the GUI for the Pachinco Game)
    Graphical Data Examples
    - TensorBoard Viszualization   
- Scheduling and Planning
