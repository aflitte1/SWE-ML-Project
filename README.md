## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This project will be a physics-based Pachinko game. There will be several “levels” with different art styles
and pachinko courses. The ball will use physics simulations to determine its path as it collides with various
obstacles. The player’s objective is to catch said ball when it eventually reaches the bottom of the course.
The player will be awarded points as they catch balls. This document will cover all requirements of the
system, including but not limited to the system features, requirements, and impact.

### 1.2 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions

The intended audience for this document are both the investors and future developers of this game. This will
serve as a guide to understanding the design decisions that were made. Future developers would find the
sections for System Features(2), Performance Requirements(3.1), and Software Quality Attributes(3.4) most
useful for their understanding of this project. Investors would find the sections for Product Scope (1.3),
System Features(2), and Business Rules(3.5) most useful for their understanding of this project.

### 1.3 Product Scope

This program will be a multi-level Pachinko game. It will have various levels with increasing levels of
difficulty. Each level will have a different art style attached to it as well. The “ball” that will be falling into
the pachinko board will use a physics simulation to determine its path down the board. At the bottom of this
board there will be a basket that will be controlled by user input. When the user successfully catches a ball in
the basket, they will be awarded a point. The software being used for this project will include objects for both
the ball and the basket as well as physics simulation software through a game engine.

## 2. System Features

### 2.1 Main Menu
 - 2.1.1 Description and Priority - Priority 2
   This menu has two buttons. The first button will be the PLAY button. Once pressed, the game will
   begin. When pressing the LEFT or RIGHT arrow keys, the game's level will change. The
   background of the main menu will change depending on what level is selected. The second
   button will be a cosmetics button. This will again open a submenu that will allow the user to
   alter several cosmetic options in the game. On the side of the main menu will be the
   leaderboard for the currently selected level. This will be the main controlling menu of the
   game, so this is a high priority, but not as high a priority as the actual levels themselves.
 - 2.1.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
   If the user presses the PLAY button, the level will begin and the player can play the game. If the user
   presses LEFT or RIGHT the level will change. If the COSMETIC button is pressed, the
   cosmetics menu will appear.

 - 2.1.3 Functional Requirements
   - REQ-1: Scoring System
      A system of providing points to a user during a game. As the user catches
      balls, their score shall increase.
   - REQ-2: Writing File to Computer
      The leaderboard information shall be stored in a separate file. As the user
      sets a score, it will be written to the file. On the main menu, said scores will
      be read from the file and displayed.
   - REQ-3: Levels to select from
      The level menu needs levels to select from.
   - REQ-4: Objects for each cosmetic item
      The cosmetics menu will need cosmetic objects and images.

### 2.2 Pachinko Game

 - 2.2.1 Description and Priority - Priority 1
   Our project will implement a physics-based Pachinko game with four levels of
   difficulty. The game's difficulty can be changed by the user within the main menu via
   a left or right button press. Each level of difficulty will have a unique animated
   background theme to further engage the user during the game. Users will be able to
   utilize power-ups like black holes to congregate the falling balls in an area, zero
   gravity to slow the falling speed of the balls, and increased basket size to aid in
   catching. The game will utilize a three-star scoring system with the requirement of
   two stars to unlock the next level of difficulty. A points range system will determine
   the number of stars a user earns during a round. To enable the points multiplier, the
   user will need to successfully capture five balls in a row to get two times points.
   Lastly, after completing a round, the user will be prompted to enter a username to be
   displayed on the leaderboard.
 - 2.2.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
   Once the user has selected a level to play, the Pachinko balls will begin to enter the
   arena. As the player presses the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys, the bucket at the
   bottom of the map will move in that respective direction. The objective is to catch as
   many balls in the basket as possible. Based on the percentage of balls caught in the
   basket at the end of the round, the player will be rewarded with either one, two, or
   three stars.
 - 2.2.3 Functional Requirements
   - REQ-1: Ball Spawning
      The rate at which the balls will spawn and where the spawn will need to be
      determined.
   - REQ-2: Physics Simulation Engine
      Utilize the pygame physics engine to give the balls realistic falling speed
      and motion throughout the game board. Some environments that will be
      implemented will be low gravity and high gravity environments.
   - REQ-3: Bucket Movement
      The bucket will need a function to move according to the user's commands.
   - REQ-4: Scoring System
      A System of providing points to a user during a game. As the user catches
      balls, their score shall increase.
### 2.3 Leaderboard
 - 2.3.1 Description and Priority - Priority 3
   Our goal for the leaderboard is to keep track of the top ten scores for each level. When you are in the
   main menu, the leaderboard should correlate to whatever level is currently selected. The
   leaderboard will sort the score where the highest score will be at the top, and the lowest score
   will be at the bottom. Each score will have the username of the person who got it and when
   they got that score. When the user exits the program, the program will write a file to the
   computer that will be called the next time the program is executed. This file will keep track of
   the scores on each leaderboard.
 - 2.3.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
   When the user gets a score higher than one of the leaderboard scores, it will congratulate the user and
   be shown the updated leaderboard. When the user returns to the main menu, the leaderboard
   will also be updated there.
 - 2.3.3 Functional Requirements
   - REQ-1: Scoring System
      A System of providing points to a user during a game. As the user catches
      balls, their score shall increase.
   - REQ-2: Writing File to Computer
      The leaderboard information shall be stored in a separate file. As the user
      sets a score, it will be written to the file. On the main menu, said scores will
      be read from the file and display the scores.

### 2.4 Cosmetics

 - 2.4.1 Description and Priority - Priority 4
   This menu will have three selection types. The first selection type will be the background image.
   There will be at least four background images, one per level. As you beat each level, its
   respective background image is unlocked. The player can then select the image, and that will
   be displayed in the background of the game. The second selection will be basket look. The
   player will be controlling a basket to catch the balls. This basket will have several different
   appearances. As the player progresses in the game. More cosmetics unlock for the user to
   select. Lastly, there will be ball image selections. Just like the background image and basket,
   the ball images will unlock as the user progresses in the game.

 - 2.4.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
   As the user's mouse hovers over a cosmetic to select. The specific image will be highlighted. If a user
   clicks on the cosmetic. It will be outlined in gold to denote that it is the currently selected
   cosmetic. From that point on, that cosmetic item will be used for its respective item.
 - 2.4.3 Functional Requirements
   - REQ-1: Scoring System
      A System of providing points to a user during a game. As the user catches
      balls, their score shall increase.
   - REQ-2: Objects for each cosmetic item
      The cosmetics menu will need cosmetic objects and images.
   - REQ-3: Unlock Requirements
      A statement that determines if a cosmetic has been unlocked yet.
